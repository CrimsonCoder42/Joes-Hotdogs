# Joes-Hotdogs

https://crimsoncoder42.github.io/Joes-Hotdogs/

You are creating a simple order system for Joe’s Hotdgs.  Joe’s has only 4 items:  hotdogs, 
fries, soda and sauerkraut.  The cost of the items is $4, $3.50, $1.50, $1 respectively.  You 
need to do the following:
 Present the order choices to the user
 Get the order quantities desired for each item 
 Calculate the order total
 Display the order plus the total
The order system needs to be implemented 4 ways:
1. Using an associative array of items and prices
2. Using a simple object format ( i.e. { })
3. Using a function object 
4. Using a class
In each case, take full advantage of the specific construct you are using.
Note that each implementation should be in a different html file.# Joes-Hotdogs
